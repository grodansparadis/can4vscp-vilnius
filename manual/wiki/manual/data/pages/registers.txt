|  1  | Enable low alarm. |
|  2  | Enable high alarm. |
|  3  | The A input is used so the real voltage is double to what is read on the A/D input. Readings will therefore be multiplied by two before they are used in reporting and calculations. |

===== Page 1 =====

The scaling is used with linearization formula

  value = k * A/D-value + m

where value is calculated as a 32-bit floating point value and where both k and m is 32-bit floating point constants.

Currently the only class of events that can be sent is [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.measurement|CLASS1.MEASUREMENT]] and with data type float.This means the class will always be set to 10. This may however change in the future.
