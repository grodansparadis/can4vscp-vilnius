====== Sync  ======

Many VSCP modules are programmed to respond to the [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.control#type_26_0x1a_sync|CLASS1.CONTROL sync event]]. This event makes it easy to get over time synchronized data from several modules.

The data sent to a module for this event is

===== Byte 0: Sensor Index =====
This byte tells which sensors on a module you want to get information from. Setting it to 255 (0xFF) tells the module that all sensors should report there value. Other values are dependent on the module used.

For the Vilnius module the following schema is used.

^ value ^ Description ^
| **0b0000xxxx** | Report status for A/D channels. //xxxx// represents the A/D channels and bit 0 should be set if a report for A/D channel 0 is wanted, bit 1 for A/D channel 1 and so on. Thus if all A/D channels should be reported the LSB nibble should be 15 0xF).  |
| **0b0001xxxx** | Report measurements. //xxxx// represents measurement calculations for channels and bit 0 should be set if a report for channel 0 is wanted, bit 1 for channel 1 and so on. Thus if measurements for all channels should be reported the LSB nibble should be 15 0xF).  |
| **0b0010xxxx** | Report I/O state. //xxxx// represents I/O bits and bit 0 should be set if a report for I/O 0 is wanted, bit 1 for I/O 1. All other bits have no meaning as there are only two I/O channels.  |
| **0b11111111** | Will send a report for all A/D values, all measurement calculations and all I/O.  |


===== Byte 1: Zone =====

Match the modules zone here. Note it's not the the zone for a channel. Set to 255 (0xFF) to match all zones).

===== Byte 2: Sub zone =====

Match the modules sub zones here. Note it's not the the sub zone for a channel. Set to 255 (0xFF) to match all sub zones).
