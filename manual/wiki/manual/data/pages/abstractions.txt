====== Abstractions ======

A VSCP unit is  describing it's configuration to the world with a register model where each register is eight bit in width. This is often inconvenient for a human user who is used to higher level types and this is what //abstractions// are there for. They sit above registers and specify types as strings, floats, integers and other such higher level types.

===== A/D value =====

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_value  |  uint16_t  | A/D value for channel 0 |
|  ch1_value  |  uint16_t  | A/D value for channel 1 |
|  ch2_value  |  uint16_t  | A/D value for channel 2 |
|  ch3_value  |  uint16_t  | A/D value for channel 3 |

===== Measurement value =====

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_measurement_value  |  float  | Measurement value for channel 0 |
|  ch1_measurement_value  |  float  | Measurement value for channel 1 |
|  ch2_measurement_value  |  float  | Measurement value for channel 2 |
|  ch3_measurement_value  |  float  | Measurement value for channel 3 |
===== A/D report interval =====

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Report interval in milliseconds for channel 0. Set to zero to disable. |
|  ch1_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Report interval in milliseconds for channel 1. Set to zero to disable. |
|  ch2_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Report interval in milliseconds for channel 2. Set to zero to disable. |
|  ch3_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Report interval in milliseconds for channel 3. Set to zero to disable. |

===== A/D low alarm =====

Low alarms will use index 0,1,2,3 to identify the origin of the alarm. See [[events|Events]] for more information.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_low_alarm  |  uint16_t  | Low alarm set point for channel 0. |
|  ch1_low_alarm  |  uint16_t  | Low alarm set point for channel 1. |

|  ch3_low_alarm  |  uint16_t  | Low alarm set point for channel 3. |

===== A/D high alarm =====

High alarms will use index 0x80,0x81,0x82,0x83 (bit 7 set of the index byte) to identify the origin of the alarm. See [[events|Events]] for more information.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch1_high_alarm  |  uint16_t  | High alarm set point for channel 0. |
|  ch2_high_alarm  |  uint16_t  | High alarm set point for channel 1. |
|  ch3_high_alarm  |  uint16_t  | High alarm set point for channel 2. |
|  ch4_high_alarm  |  uint16_t  | High alarm set point for channel 3. |

===== Measurement report interval =====

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_measurement_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Measurement report interval for channel 0. Set to zero to disable. |
|  ch1_measurement_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Measurement report interval for channel 1. Set to zero to disable. |
|  ch2_measurement_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Measurement report interval for channel 2. Set to zero to disable. |
|  ch3_measurement_report_interval  |  uint16_t  | Measurement report interval for channel 3. Set to zero to disable. |

===== A/D absolute low value =====

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_low  |  uint16_t  | Absolute low value for channel 0 |
|  ch1_low  |  uint16_t  | Absolute low value for channel 1 |
|  ch2_low  |  uint16_t  | Absolute low value for channel 2 |
|  ch3_low  |  uint16_t  | Absolute low value for channel 3 |


===== A/D absolute high value =====

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_high  |  uint16_t  | Absolute high value for channel 0 |
|  ch1_high  |  uint16_t  | Absolute high value for channel 1 |
|  ch2_high  |  uint16_t  | Absolute high value for channel 2 |
|  ch3_high  |  uint16_t  | Absolute high value for channel 3 |

===== k constants for linearization =====

Linearization is available so a measurement y can be calculated from 

  y = k*x + m

where x is either the current counter value for a channel or the current frequency for a channel.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_k  |  float  | k-constant for linearization of channel 0 A/D value |
|  ch1_k  |  float  | k-constant for linearization of channel 1 A/D value |
|  ch2_k  |  float  | k-constant for linearization of channel 2 A/D value |
|  ch3_k  |  float  | k-constant for linearization of channel 3 A/D value |

===== m constants for linearization =====

Linearization is available so a measurement y can be calculated from 

  y = k*x + m

where x is either the current counter value for a channel or the current frequency for a channel.

^  Name  ^  Type  ^ Description ^
|  ch0_m  |  float  | m-constant for linearization of channel 0 A/D value. |
|  ch1_m  |  float  | m-constant for linearization of channel 1 A/D value |
|  ch2_m  |  float  | m-constant for linearization of channel 2 A/D value |
|  ch3_m  |  float  | m-constant for linearization of channel 3 A/D value |
