35 - On/off sample time Channel 4 (milli-seconds) MSB. Read/Write
36 - On/off sample time Channel 4 (milli-seconds) LSB. Read/Write

This is the sample time for the each channel expressed in milli-seconds. 
The min sample time is 10 milli-seconds and the max time is 65535 mili-seconds which 
is about 1 minute. Set to zero (default) for no sample time.

If periodic events are enabled they will be sent with the period set here.

If event on change is enabled they will be sent with the period set here if the 
value has changed since the last read with a hysteresis set in the hysteresis register.

If stream is enabled stream events will be sent out when the stream buffer is full 
(2 samples).

If A/D change values are enabled be careful not to have a low sample period as this 
will most certain flood the bus.

The scaling is used with the formula

value = k * A/D-value + m

where value is calculated as a signed long (4 bytes).

The value is always sent as a normalized integer of Class=10 (0x0a) Measurement. 
The datacoding is should be set to 0b100xx000 where xx is the type for the measurement 
(0b00 if default) see http://www.vscp.org/wiki/doku.php?id=vscp_specification_data_coding.

Finally the measurement type is one of the types defined for Class=10 (0x0a) Measurement.
